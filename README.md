# Preparation of KITTI data for DoCNN

Some hacky-not-so-clean scripts to prepare the KITTI datatset for the re-implementation of the DoCNN ([Fast LIDAR-based Road Detection Using Fully Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03613)).

This re-implementation was performed in the scope of a hackathon (about autonomous driving by mechlab in Dresden).

The implementation of DoCNN can be found [here](https://github.com/JonasHoefer/hackathon/tree/autoencoder).
